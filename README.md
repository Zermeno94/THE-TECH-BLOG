### Installation  üíæ
User will need to install node dependencies. The application should use [express-handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars) package to implement Handlebars.js for your Views, use the [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) packages to connect to a MySQL database for your Models, and create an Express.js API for your Controllers.

You‚Äôll also need the [dotenv package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to use environment variables, the [bcrypt package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) to hash passwords, and the [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) and [connect-session-sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-session-sequelize) packages to add authentication.

**Note**: The [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) package stores the session data on the client in a cookie. When you are idle on the site for more than a set time, the cookie will expire and you will be required to log in again to start a new session. This is the default behavior and you do not have to do anything to your application other than implement the npm package. The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
  npm install 
``` 
```bash
  npm start
```
